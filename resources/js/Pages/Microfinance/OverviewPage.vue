How Carbon Fund Works
</h5>
<p>
Carbon Fund offers financial assistance in the form of loans and borrowing options for eligible projects focused on carbon reduction. Organisations and individuals can apply for funding to implement various initiatives, such as renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, and waste management systems.<br/>
These projects not only help reduce carbon emissions but also generate carbon credits that can be sold in local and international carbon markets, creating a sustainable revenue stream.

<h5>Promoting Financial Inclusion</h5>
<p>
The Carbon Fund is committed to promoting financial inclusion by ensuring that all stakeholders, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and grassroots organisations, have access to funding opportunities. <br/>This inclusivity enables a broader range of projects to contribute to Uganda's climate goals and fosters economic resilience within communities.
</p>

<div class="mb-4">
<h5>Why Invest in Carbon Credit?</h5>
<p>
Carbon credit investment provides an opportunity for businesses and investors to make a measurable difference in the fight against climate change. <br/>
By purchasing carbon credits generated by projects within Uganda, investors not only offset their carbon footprint but also contribute to the growth of local, eco-friendly initiatives. Each credit represents a ton of CO₂ avoided or removed, making every investment a direct step towards a more sustainable Uganda.
</p>
<p>
Whether you’re an organisation looking to meet corporate sustainability goals or an individual interested in climate positive investments, we guide you on how to investiment in impactful projects.

<h5>Borrowing and Loans</h5>
<p>
Our lending services are designed to help projects focused on reducing emissions, such as solar energy initiatives, green infrastructure development, and efficient waste management, take root and flourish. <br/>
Our aim is to lower financial barriers, making it easier for communities and businesses to embark on sustainable projects that can generate and sustain carbon credits.
</p>
<p>
Our loans offer low-interest rates and flexible terms to suit the varying needs of climate-conscious initiatives and we ensure that projects receive the financial support needed to create a lasting impact, while helping Uganda move closer to its climate and economic development goals.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bold text-dark">Repaying Loans Using Carbon Credit-Generated Funds:</span> Our loan repayment model provides a unique opportunity for project owners to repay their loans using the revenue generated from carbon credit sales. <br/>
This model allows for a self-sustaining cycle of green investment, where project success fuels further growth, benefiting both the project owners and the community as a whole.
<br/>
In addition to loan repayment, this model also ensures that the benefits of carbon finance flow directly to local projects, empowering them to expand and innovate.
