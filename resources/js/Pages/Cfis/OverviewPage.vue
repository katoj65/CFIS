Why You Should Measure Carbon Footprint?
</h5>
<p>
Measuring a carbon footprint is an essential step for any organisation, individual, or government aiming to mitigate climate change.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Measuring your carbon footprint helps you gain insights into where emissions come from in your activities, processes, or supply chains. This makes it easier to target and prioritize areas for reduction.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Establishing a baseline carbon footprint provides a reference point to measure progress against. You can track emission reductions over time, set realistic targets, and hold yourself accountable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Data-driven approach supports Uganda’s national climate goals, including its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, by encouraging emissions reductions at all levels.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Enhancement of reputation and competitiveness by demonstrating awareness and action on emissions, organisations can improve their reputation, attract investment, and stay competitive in a market that values sustainability.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Unlocking carbon credits and finance opportunities. Organisations that measure their emissions contribute to a more transparent and comprehensive national carbon footprint.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fostering community and environmental resilience by improving air quality, water quality, soil quality, reducing climate risks, and supporting biodiversity and environmental health.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Meeting Compliance and national regulations. Measuring emissions can ensure you’re ahead of these requirements, potentially benefiting from incentives like tax breaks or subsidies for emission reduction efforts.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
