<p class="mb-0">
    The Uganda Carbon Registry is an innovative initiative designed to monitor carbon emissions across the country. Its goal is to accurately track and report emissions to support Uganda's climate objectives. The registry provides access to carbon markets, allowing businesses and organisations to participate in carbon offsetting efforts, which can help reduce overall emissions and contribute to Uganda’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Additionally, the registry includes carbon microfinance, offering local communities financial tools to adopt zero-emission technologies and promote biodiversity preservation. In this way, the Uganda Carbon Registry plays a crucial role in guiding the nation towards sustainable development and building resilience in the face of climate change.

<h5 class="mb-0 mt-5">The Cost of Climate Change on Uganda’s Economy</h5>
<p class="my-3">
    Climate change is having a significant impact on Uganda, costing the economy an estimated $3.2 billion annually. This has led to a humanitarian crisis marked by extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, which are threatening people's livelihoods and causing displacement. Vulnerable populations are facing increased risks of food insecurity and loss of homes. The degradation of Uganda’s natural resources and biodiversity is worsening the crisis, endangering essential ecosystems for the economy and the community. Without intervention, Uganda could face future economic losses amounting to 5-10% of GDP each year. However, there are opportunities for improvement if immediate action is taken, such as investing in sustainable practices, renewable energy, and carbon mitigation projects. This could help Uganda build a more resilient economy. The Uganda Carbon Registry is at the forefront of these efforts, providing tools to monitor emissions, create carbon credits, and align with international climate goals to protect Uganda’s future.

<h5 class="mt-5">Our Objectives</h5>
<p class="py-3">
    The Uganda Carbon Registry has several main goals to advance the country’s efforts to address climate change. First, it helps to monitor emissions, ensuring accurate reporting and transparency in carbon accounting. It also gives access to carbon markets, allowing local businesses and projects to trade carbon credits and access carbon financing through innovative methods like carbon microfinance. The registry supports mapping areas most affected by climate change, enabling targeted interventions in vulnerable regions while safeguarding the country's biodiversity. Additionally, it provides early warning systems for climate-related risks, influencing data-driven decisions and guiding investment in sustainable solutions. Lastly, the registry helps with emission reporting, aligning Uganda with its international climate obligations, and supporting informed decision-making at both the national and global levels.

<h5 class="mb-0 ">Steering Financial Inclusion</h5>
<p class="mt-3 mb-2">
The Uganda Carbon Registry is helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access funding for projects that reduce carbon emissions through its carbon credit microfinance services. By creating carbon credits, SMEs can access new financial opportunities and invest in initiatives that reduce and remove carbon. The registry offers guidance for making informed investment decisions and supporting projects that align with Uganda's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and its goal of reaching net zero emissions. Through these efforts, we aim to build a more inclusive, sustainable economy and empower businesses to contribute significantly to climate action.

<div class="my-4">
<h5 class="mb-0 ">Carbon Market Growth</h5>
<p class="mt-3 mb-2">
The global carbon credit market boasts a value exceeding $300 billion and exhibits significant growth potential, particularly within the African context. Uganda stands to enhance its standing in the carbon market by safeguarding its natural resources, fostering its capacity for carbon credit generation, and integrating the carbon market with financial services through innovative carbon credit microfinance. This strategic approach will fortify Uganda's position within the burgeoning African carbon market, presently estimated at approximately $6 billion. The Uganda Carbon Registry is actively engaged in integrating carbon credit microfinance with financial services, advocating for the preservation of natural resources, and augmenting Uganda's carbon market valuation.

<h5 class="mb-0"> A Growing Crisis</h5>
<div class="mt-3">
<p class="">
    The Ugandan economy is increasingly being impacted by climate change, which has far-reaching consequences for various sectors and the livelihoods of its people. The major causes of climate change in Uganda are carbon emissions, primarily from deforestation, agriculture, energy production, and transport. Uganda's carbon emissions result from activities such as burning fossil fuels, land-use change, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Each sector contributes to emissions, with agriculture accounting for about 25%, transport 12%, energy production 16%, and deforestation around 20%, making it a significant driver of Uganda's overall greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p class="">
The Uganda Carbon Registry plays a critical role in harnessing this potential by creating a credible, transparent, and accessible market for carbon credits. By doing so, we help Uganda meet its climate goals while providing economic opportunities for local communities.

<h5 class="mb-0">Our Impact</h5>
<div class="mt-3">
<ul>
<li>
<p class="">
Enabling access to carbon finance for local communities and businesses through carbon credit generation, trading and microfinance services.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">
Supporting sustainable land use and protecting Uganda’s forests, wetlands, and other natural resources by promoting carbon offset projects like reforestation and land restoration.
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="">
Empowering communities to adopt climate-smart practices, from clean energy solutions to sustainable agriculture, that not only reduce emissions but also improve livelihoods.
</p></li>
<li>
<p class="">
Enhancing transparency in Uganda’s carbon market by ensuring that emissions reductions are tracked, verified, and reported with integrity.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="">
Strengthens Uganda’s carbon economy, making it a more attractive destination for international carbon finance and helping to position the country as a leader in climate action on the African continent.
</p>
</li>



<li>
<p class="">
Creating green jobs. Projects funded through microfinance, such as clean energy installations or forest restoration, create employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas where jobs are often scarce.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p class="">
Boosting local investment. As carbon credits are sold and revenues are reinvested, local economies benefit from the multiplier effect, as income generated from climate projects is spent within communities, stimulating economic growth.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
