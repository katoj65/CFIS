Who We Are
</h5>
<p>
    The Uganda Carbon Registry is an innovative initiative designed to monitor carbon emissions across the country. Its goal is to accurately track and report emissions to support Uganda's climate objectives. The registry provides access to carbon markets, allowing businesses and organisations to participate in carbon offsetting efforts, which can help reduce overall emissions and contribute to Uganda’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Additionally, the registry includes carbon fund, offering local communities financial tools to adopt zero-emission technologies and promote biodiversity preservation. In this way, the Uganda Carbon Registry plays a crucial role in guiding the nation towards sustainable development and building resilience in the face of climate change.

    The Impact of Climate Change on Uganda’s Economy
</h5>
<p>
    Climate change is having a significant impact on Uganda, costing the economy an estimated $3.2 billion annually. This has led to a humanitarian crisis marked by extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, which are threatening people's livelihoods and causing displacement.
    <br/>
    Vulnerable populations are facing increased risks of food insecurity and loss of homes. The degradation of Uganda’s natural resources and biodiversity is worsening the crisis, endangering essential ecosystems for the economy and the community. Without intervention, Uganda could face future economic losses amounting to 5-10% of GDP each year. However, there are opportunities for improvement if immediate action is taken, such as investing in sustainable practices, renewable energy, and carbon mitigation projects.
    <br/> This could help Uganda build a more resilient economy. The Uganda Carbon Registry is at the forefront of these efforts, providing tools to monitor emissions, create carbon credits, and align with international climate goals to protect Uganda’s future

    Our Objectives
</h5>
<p>
The Uganda Carbon Registry has several main goals to advance the country’s efforts to address climate change. First, it helps to monitor emissions, ensuring accurate reporting and transparency in carbon accounting.<br/>
It also gives access to carbon markets, allowing local businesses and projects to trade carbon credits and access carbon financing through innovative methods like carbon fund.<br/> The registry supports mapping areas most affected by climate change, enabling targeted interventions in vulnerable regions while safeguarding the country's biodiversity.
Additionally, it provides early warning systems for climate-related risks, influencing data-driven decisions and guiding investment in sustainable solutions. Lastly, the registry helps with emission reporting, aligning Uganda with its international climate obligations, and supporting informed decision-making at both the national and global levels.

Carbon Footprint Management
</h5>
<p>
The importance of monitoring and reducing carbon footprints has never been more critical. As Uganda strives to meet its climate commitments, understanding and managing carbon footprints becomes increasingly important for both public and private sectors.
<br/>
The CFIS plays a vital role in assessing the impact of various sectors on carbon emissions, enabling stakeholders to identify key areas for improvement and intervention.
<br/>
By providing accurate data on emissions, the system helps organisations and policymakers make informed decisions, ultimately supporting Uganda's sustainable development goals. Furthermore, it raises awareness among businesses and communities about their carbon footprints, encouraging a collective effort to reduce emissions and promote climate resilience.

    <h5 class="py-2">
        Steering Financial Inclusion
    </h5>
    <p>
The Uganda Carbon Registry is helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access funding for projects that reduce carbon emissions through its carbon credit microfinance services.
<br/>By creating carbon credits, SMEs can access new financial opportunities and invest in initiatives that reduce and remove carbon. The registry offers guidance for making informed investment decisions and supporting projects that align with Uganda's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and its goal of reaching net zero emissions. <br/>Through these efforts, we aim to build a more inclusive, sustainable economy and empower businesses to contribute significantly to climate action.

Carbon Market Growth
</h5>
<p>
The global carbon credit market boasts a value exceeding $300 billion and exhibits significant growth potential, particularly within the African context.
<br/> Uganda stands to enhance its standing in the carbon market by safeguarding its natural resources, fostering its capacity for carbon credit generation, and integrating the carbon market with financial services through innovative carbon credit microfinance.
<br/>
This strategic approach will fortify Uganda's position within the burgeoning African carbon market, presently estimated at approximately $6 billion. The Uganda Carbon Registry is actively engaged in integrating carbon credit microfinance with financial services, advocating for the preservation of natural resources, and augmenting Uganda's carbon market valuation. <Inertia-link :href="route('carbon-markets')" class="ml-2 text-danger">Read more   <b-icon icon="arrow-right"></b-icon></Inertia-link>

    Opportunties for Uganda and Africa
    </h5>
    <p>
    Uganda stands at a pivotal moment in climate financing, with significant opportunities for growth and development through the carbon market.
    <br/> The global carbon market is valued at approximately $949 billion, showcasing immense potential for countries that engage in carbon credit trading.
    <br/>
    In Africa, the carbon market is estimated to reach approximately $2 billion by 2030, highlighting the continent's emerging role in the climate finance landscape.
    <br/>
    Carbon credits play a crucial role in this framework, allowing countries and businesses to offset their greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere. Uganda can capitalize on this by developing smart carbon fund services that provide accessible financing options for smallholder farmers and businesses aiming to implement sustainable practices.<br/>
    The Uganda Carbon Registry is determined to take a lead in this sector, establishing a transparent platform for tracking carbon credits and fostering market participation. Key sectors that may benefit from these initiatives include agriculture, renewable energy, forestry, and waste management, all of which are essential for reducing emissions while enhancing economic resilience.
