<h4 class=" mb-4">Why Training and Capacity Building Matter</h4>

<p class="mb-0">
For Uganda to maximize the benefits of carbon credits and sustainable development, a strong foundation of knowledge and expertise is crucial. Training and capacity building help local communities, businesses, and policymakers understand how carbon markets work, how to develop and manage carbon credit projects, and how to ensure their initiatives meet international standards.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
Empowering stakeholders with the right skills ensures that Uganda can effectively participate in carbon trading, generate reliable carbon credits, and unlock the financial and environmental rewards that come with climate action.
