                    <h5 class="display-7 mb-2">Why is Carbon Microfinance Important?</h5>

                    <p>
                        Carbon microfinance plays a crucial role in facilitating climate action at the grassroots level. Numerous climate mitigation projects, such as clean cooking stoves or small-scale solar energy systems, necessitate initial investment, which can be difficult for low-income communities and small businesses. Carbon microfinance addresses this issue by offering affordable, low-interest loans to support these initiatives.

Why Invest in Carbon Reduction and Removal?
</h5>
<p class="mt-2">
    Investing in carbon reduction and removal projects is crucial for Uganda to achieve its climate goals. Carbon microfinance services allow communities, small businesses, and organisations to implement impactful carbon reduction strategies that they might not otherwise be able to afford. Financing these projects leads to lower carbon emissions, increased economic growth, and enhanced biodiversity.
    <br/>
    Big organisations can have a significant impact on supporting Uganda's carbon mitigation efforts by purchasing carbon credits from projects funded through the Uganda Carbon Registry. This action allows them to offset their own emissions, aid local climate initiatives, and contribute to Uganda’s overall carbon reduction goals.

<p class=" mb-4"> Through smart climate financing, we bridge the gap between project developers and the financial resources needed to combat climate change.</p>






<h5 class="mb-0 ">How It Works</h5>
<ol class="mt-1 list_number">
<li>
<p class=" ">
Project proposal. Submit a detailed proposal outlining the carbon reduction project.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=" ">
Evaluation. Our team evaluates the project’s feasibility, potential carbon savings, and eligibility for carbon credit generation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=" ">
Savings requirement. Applicants are encouraged to start a savings plan with the Uganda Carbon Registry, helping build financial discipline and security.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=" ">
Loan approval. Once approved, you receive the loan to implement the project.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=" ">
Implementation and support. We provide technical assistance and monitor the project’s progress to ensure it meets the required standards.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=" ">
Carbon credit generation. Upon successful implementation, the project generates carbon credits that are certified by the Uganda Carbon Registry.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class=" ">
Loan repayment. Part of the carbon credits generated from the project can be used to repay the loan, creating a sustainable cycle of climate financing.
</p>
</li>

</ol>



<h5 class="mb-0  mt-4">Repayment with Carbon Credits</h5>
<p class=" mt-2">
    The Carbon Microfinance program offers a unique feature - borrowers can repay loans using the carbon credits generated by the project. This helps borrowers repay their loans without financial strain. As the project generates revenue from selling carbon credits, a portion of these credits is used to repay the loans, ensuring the sustainability of both the project and the microfinance service.
