<h5>
    Why Develop Carbon Projects?
</h5>
<p>
    Developing a carbon project contributes directly to Uganda’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and aligns with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. By creating carbon reduction and offsetting projects, stakeholders help to reduce emissions, enhance biodiversity, and drive sustainable economic growth.<br/>Uganda’s unique natural environment offers significant potential for high-impact projects, especially in sectors like forestry, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture.
