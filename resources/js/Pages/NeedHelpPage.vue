<h4>Why Carbon Mitigation Projects in Uganda?</h4>
<p class="mb-4">Carbon mitigation projects help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing to a more sustainable future. In Uganda, these projects also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Support community development. By promoting sustainable agriculture, reforestation, and renewable energy, these projects improve livelihoods and boost the local economy.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Tackle climate change locally and globally. Uganda’s ecosystems are under pressure due to climate change. Carbon mitigation projects protect forests, soils, and water resources, making a global impact.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Unlock funding opportunities. With international demand for verified carbon credits growing, Uganda has great potential to become a hub for climate-conscious investment.

</p>
</li>
</ul>
